        """A class for encoding an intervention to a network to reach a target subspace.

        Generally, this class is created by the
        :func:`succession_control<biobalm.control.succession_control>` function,
        which returns a list of `Intervention` objects. Manipulating the
        contents of these objects is only recommended for advanced use cases.
        Typically, it is sufficient to print this object to see a human-readable
        explanation of how to interpret the intervention.

        Note that two interventions are considered to be equal if they act on the same succession with
        equal controls applied to each subspace in the succession. Thus, two
        interventions that override the same nodes in the same way can be
        unequal, even when applied to the same subspaces. This is because each
        subspace imposes a duration condition on the overrides, i.e., the
        override must be maintained until the succession subspace is reached.
        Changing the order of the subspaces considered can alter this stop
        condition.

        Parameters
        ----------
        control : list[ControlOverrides]
            The :class:`ControlOverrides<biobalm.types.ControlOverrides>` objects,
            in order, that are applied. The order of the list corresponds the
            order of the subspaces in the succession. Each
            :class:`ControlOverrides<biobalm.types.ControlOverrides>` object
            represens a list of overrides, stored as a dictionary of node-value
            pairs, that drive the system to the corresponding subspace. Each
            :class:`ControlOverrides<biobalm.types.ControlOverrides>` object is
            sorted by key value (i.e., alphabetically) upon creation of the
            `Intervention` object to maintain a canonical ordering.
        strategy : str
            Either "internal" or "all"; "internal" means that the
            :class:`ControlOverrides<biobalm.types.ControlOverrides>`
        succession : SubspaceSuccession
            A sequence of subspaces that are targeted by the corresponding
            entries of `control`.
